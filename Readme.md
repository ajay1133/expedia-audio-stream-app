This repo contains both client & server code for the purpose of demonstration but actual code will 
reside separately for client & server on github for deployment CI/CD & other actions

Client is built in react.js & contains its separate package.json file.
Server is built in node.js with express & contains its separate package.json file

To run the project go to /server, copy the '.env' file & add your AWS configuration
